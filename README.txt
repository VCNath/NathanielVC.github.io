Prologue by HTML5 UP
Modified by [Your Name]

This is my personal website, a simple and responsive site built using the Prologue template. It showcases my work and provides information about me.

The design is based on the clean and minimalistic Prologue template by HTML5 UP, with a sticky sidebar and navigation-linked scrolling.
